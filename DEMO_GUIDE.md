# RenovaAI Demo Guide

## üéØ **How to Use the App**

### Step 1: Upload Kitchen Image
1. **Select Image**: Click "Choose File" and upload a photo of your kitchen
2. **Image Requirements**: Clear, well-lit photos work best
3. **Supported Formats**: JPG, PNG, WebP

### Step 2: Add Measurements (Optional but Recommended)
1. **Measurement Tool Appears**: After uploading, you'll see the "Add Measurements (Optional)" section
2. **Draw Measurement Lines**: 
   - Click and drag on the image to create measurement lines
   - Lines must be at least 20 pixels long to be saved
   - Yellow lines appear while drawing, red lines when saved

3. **Add Real Dimensions**:
   - A modal appears after each line
   - Enter the actual measurement (e.g., "3.6" for 3.6 meters)
   - Select the unit (m, cm, ft, in) - **Metric units are recommended**
   - Choose measurement type (wall, furniture space, ceiling, counter)

### Step 3: Select Generation Mode
- **Redesign**: Transform existing kitchen with new style while keeping layout
- **Design**: Fully furnish an empty room with furniture

### Step 4: Choose Design Style
Popular options: Modern, Traditional, Scandinavian, Industrial, etc.

### Step 5: Generate Your Design
- Click "Generate Design" 
- Processing takes 30-60 seconds
- Results show your redesigned kitchen

## üéØ **Measurement Guidelines**

### Essential Measurements
- **Consistent Units**: Stick to one unit system (all meters or all centimeters)
- **Key Dimensions**: Focus on longest wall and ceiling height
- **Room Understanding**: 2-4 measurements give optimal AI understanding

### Room Size Categories
- **Small Rooms** (< 2.4m width): Compact, space-efficient furniture
- **Medium Rooms** (2.4-4.9m width): Standard-sized furniture with comfortable proportions  
- **Large Rooms** (> 4.9m width): Generous, full-size furniture that fills the space

### Measurement Types
- **Wall**: Room length, width, or wall heights
- **Furniture Space**: Areas designated for specific furniture
- **Ceiling**: Room height from floor to ceiling  
- **Counter**: Depth of countertops or work surfaces

## üéØ **Example Measurements**

### Small Galley Kitchen
- Wall length: 4.3m (longest wall)
- Ceiling height: 2.4m
- Counter depth: 60cm
- Walkway width: 120cm

**Result**: Compact galley layout with wall-mounted cabinets, no center island

### Medium Kitchen  
- Room width: 5.5m
- Room length: 6.7m
- Ceiling height: 3.0m
- Island space: 2.4m x 1.2m

**Result**: Standard kitchen with island, ample counter space, and proper traffic flow

### Large Kitchen
- Wall length: 3.7m
- Wall width: 3.0m  
- Ceiling height: 2.7m
- Counter depth: 75cm

**Result**: Spacious layout with large island, multiple work zones, and generous storage

## üéØ **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues
1. **Lines Won't Save**: Make sure lines are at least 20 pixels long
2. **Generation Fails**: Check your internet connection and try again
3. **Measurements Don't Apply**: Ensure you've entered numerical values and selected units
4. **Blurry Results**: Try uploading a higher quality image

### Best Practices
- Upload clear, well-lit photos
- Draw measurement lines along obvious architectural features
- Use real measurements (not estimates) for best results
- Focus on the most important dimensions (room width/length)

## üéØ **Understanding Results**

### Design Generation
- **AI Analysis**: Creates furniture layouts based on your measurements
- **Style Application**: Applies your chosen aesthetic consistently
- **Spatial Logic**: Considers room proportions and traffic flow

### Furniture Analysis
- **Smart Detection**: Identifies individual furniture pieces
- **Realistic Sizing**: Scales furniture to match room dimensions
- **Placement Logic**: Positions furniture for optimal functionality

### Measurement Integration
- Measurements are converted to metric for consistency
- Room analysis determines optimal furniture scale
- Spatial constraints prevent unrealistic layouts (e.g., islands in narrow spaces)

### Architectural Plans
After generating your kitchen redesign, RenovaAI now provides architectural blueprints with precise measurements:

#### Plan View Features
- **Professional Layout**: Top-down view showing furniture placement
- **Accurate Scaling**: All items drawn to scale with your measurements
- **Detailed Labels**: Each furniture piece clearly labeled and dimensioned
- **Multiple Views**: Elevation and plan views for complete understanding

#### Blueprint Information
- **Precise Measurements**: Each furniture piece shows exact dimensions in metric
- **Material Specifications**: Details about countertops, cabinets, and finishes
- **Technical Notes**: Installation requirements and building considerations
- **Shopping Lists**: Itemized furniture with estimated sizes and priorities

## üéØ **Pro Tips**

### Do's
‚úÖ **Measure Key Walls**: Get the longest wall and ceiling height  
‚úÖ **Use Real Measurements**: Actual dimensions produce realistic furniture  
‚úÖ **Clear Photos**: Well-lit, uncluttered images work best  
‚úÖ **Consistent Units**: Stick to metric (meters/cm) for best results  
‚úÖ **Multiple Angles**: Try different measurement lines for better understanding

### Don'ts  
‚ùå Don't add too many measurements (4-6 is optimal)
‚ùå Don't use estimated or guessed measurements
‚ùå Don't draw lines on unclear or blurry areas
‚ùå Don't mix measurement units within the same project
‚ùå Don't expect perfect results without any measurements
