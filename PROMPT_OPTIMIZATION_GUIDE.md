# Prompt Optimization Guide for Better Structure Preservation

## Overview

This guide explains the prompt optimization improvements made to enhance structure preservation while reducing token usage and improving AI model performance.

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. **Over-detailed Prompts**
- **Problem**: Prompts were extremely verbose (200+ tokens) with many details not present in the original image
- **Impact**: Confused the AI model, leading to poor structure preservation
- **Solution**: Reduced prompts to 30-50 tokens focusing on essential elements

### 2. **Token Efficiency**
- **Problem**: Long prompts increased API costs and processing time
- **Impact**: Slower generation and higher costs
- **Solution**: Streamlined prompts while maintaining functionality

### 3. **Structure Preservation**
- **Problem**: Complex prompts overwhelmed the model's ability to preserve original layout
- **Impact**: Generated images with completely different room structures
- **Solution**: Clear, concise instructions focusing on "PRESERVE layout, walls, windows"

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. **Concise Prompt Structure**

**Before (verbose):**
```
Interior design photo: Transform this kitchen to EXACTLY match this inspiration style: [200+ word description]. Keep the original room layout and architectural structure, but redesign ALL elements (cabinets, countertops, appliances, lighting, colors, materials) to precisely recreate the inspiration aesthetic. Match the exact colors, cabinet styles, materials, and lighting shown in the inspiration image. Professional interior photography, high resolution, sharp details, realistic lighting, 8K quality.
```

**After (optimized):**
```
Redesign kitchen: [key style elements]. PRESERVE layout, walls, windows. Change colors, materials only. Professional interior photo, realistic lighting.
```

### 2. **Inspiration Analysis Optimization**

**Before**: Used full inspiration description (100+ words)
**After**: Extract only key style elements (first 50 words for redesign, 40 for design)

```python
# Extract key style elements only
key_style_elements = ' '.join(inspiration_style_description.split()[:50])
enhanced_redesign_prompt = f"Redesign kitchen: {key_style_elements}. PRESERVE layout, walls, windows. Change colors, materials only."
```

### 3. **Measurement Integration**

**Before**: Long measurement context with detailed explanations
**After**: Concise spatial constraints

```python
if max_width < 3.0:  # Narrow space
    measurement_prompt = f" NARROW SPACE {max_width:.1f}m: galley layout only, NO center island."
elif max_width < 3.7:  # Medium space
    measurement_prompt = f" MEDIUM SPACE {max_width:.1f}m: compact island max 120cm if space allows."
else:  # Large space
    measurement_prompt = f" LARGE SPACE {max_width:.1f}m: full island and seating allowed."
```

### 4. **Simplified Negative Prompts**

**Before**: Extremely long list of negatives (100+ words)
**After**: Focused on key structure preservation

```python
# Simplified negative prompts - focus on key structure preservation
negative_prompt = "different room layout, moving walls, changing windows, different architecture, blurry, low quality, cartoon"

# Add spatial-specific negatives only for narrow spaces
if room_width and room_width < 3.0:
    negative_prompt += ", kitchen island, center island, middle furniture"
```

## Model Parameters Optimization

### 1. **Structure Preservation Settings**
- **prompt_strength**: Reduced from 0.9 to 0.3 for maximum structure preservation
- **guidance_scale**: Reduced from 10.0+ to 7.5-8.0 for better balance

### 2. **Model Selection Priority**
1. **ControlNet Canny** (primary): Maximum structure preservation
2. **adirik/interior-design** (fallback): Good balance of quality and control
3. **SDXL** (final fallback): General purpose with optimized parameters

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. **For Redesign Mode**
```python
# Focus on structure preservation
base_prompt = f"Redesign kitchen: {style}. PRESERVE layout, walls, windows. Change colors, materials only."

# Add spatial constraints only when needed
if narrow_space:
    base_prompt += f" NARROW {width}m: galley layout, NO center island."
```

### 2. **For Design Mode**
```python
# Focus on realistic furniture placement
base_prompt = f"Furnish {room_type}: {style}. Include: {furniture_list}. Realistic furniture."

# Adjust furniture for space constraints
if narrow_kitchen:
    furniture_list = "wall cabinets, countertops, appliances along walls, NO center island"
```

### 3. **Measurement Integration**
- Keep measurement prompts concise and specific
- Focus on spatial constraints that affect layout
- Use clear, actionable language for the AI model

- Develop style-specific prompt templates

### 3. **Performance Monitoring**
- Track structure preservation metrics
- Monitor token usage and costs
- Collect user feedback on result quality

## Conclusion

The prompt optimization significantly improves structure preservation while reducing costs and processing time. The key is to provide clear, concise instructions that focus on essential elements rather than overwhelming the model with excessive detail.

**Key Takeaway**: Less is more when it comes to AI prompts for architectural design. Clear, focused instructions produce better results than verbose, detailed descriptions.
