# Structure Preservation Improvements Guide

## Issues Identified with Previous Results

The previous kitchen redesign results showed poor structure preservation due to several technical issues:

### 1. **Over-aggressive Parameters**
- `prompt_strength: 0.9` was too high, causing excessive image modification
- `guidance_scale: 10.0+` was forcing the model to follow prompts too strictly
- This resulted in complete layout changes rather than surface-level styling

### 2. **Inadequate Prompts**
- Prompts didn't explicitly emphasize structure preservation
- Missing specific instructions to maintain cabinet placement, walls, windows
- Negative prompts weren't comprehensive enough to prevent structural changes

### 3. **Missing ControlNet Edge Detection**
- No Canny edge detection for outline preservation
- Relying only on interior design model without proper structure constraints

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Optimized Parameters for Structure Preservation**
```python
# NEW: Much better structure preservation
"prompt_strength": 0.3-0.5  # Reduced from 0.9
"guidance_scale": 7.5        # Reduced from 10.0+
"num_inference_steps": 50    # Increased for better quality
```

### 2. **Enhanced ControlNet Pipeline**
- **Primary**: ControlNet Canny edge detection (`jagilley/controlnet-canny`) with `prompt_strength: 0.3`
- **Fallback**: Interior design model with improved parameters
- **Final Fallback**: SDXL with conservative settings

### 3. **Structure-Preserving Prompts**
```python
# NEW: Explicit structure preservation
"PRESERVE the original room layout, wall positions, window placements, and cabinet structure. 
Only change colors, materials, finishes, and decorative elements"
```

### 4. **Enhanced Negative Prompts**
```python
# NEW: Comprehensive structural restrictions
"completely different kitchen layout, removing cabinets, moving cabinets, 
changing cabinet placement, different window positions, altered wall structure, 
repositioned appliances, different room configuration"
```

## Expected Results

With these changes, you should now see:

1. **Preserved Layout**: Cabinets, windows, walls stay in the same positions
2. **Surface-Level Changes**: Only colors, materials, finishes change
3. **Maintained Functionality**: Kitchen workflow and spacing preserved
4. **Style Application**: Inspiration styles applied without structural disruption

## Testing the Improvements

1. Upload the same kitchen image you used before
2. Use the same inspiration image/style
3. Generate a new result
4. Compare: The new result should maintain the original kitchen's structure while only changing the aesthetic elements

## Technical Details

### Model Hierarchy (Best to Worst for Structure Preservation)
1. **ControlNet Canny** (`prompt_strength: 0.3`) - Maximum structure preservation
2. **Interior Design Model** (`prompt_strength: 0.5`) - Good balance
3. **SDXL** (`prompt_strength: 0.4`) - Conservative fallback

### Key Parameter Changes
- **Prompt Strength**: Reduced by 40-70% for all models
- **Guidance Scale**: Reduced by 25-40% for better balance
- **Inference Steps**: Increased by 40% for better quality
- **Edge Detection**: Added as primary method

This multi-layered approach ensures maximum structure preservation while still allowing for beautiful style transformations.
