    🎯 Training Prompts Examples:
    
    ✅ GOOD (What you want):
    - "galley kitchen 3m wide, linear wall cabinets, no island, modern style"
    - "narrow kitchen space, single wall layout, built-in appliances only"
    - "linear kitchen design, wall-mounted configuration, clear center walkway"
    - "compact galley kitchen, one-wall layout, modern finishes, no center furniture"
    
    ❌ NEGATIVE (What to avoid - include some for contrast):
    - "spacious kitchen with large island, wide layout"
    - "kitchen with center island, U-shaped with island, peninsula design"
    
    📏 Measurement Integration:
    - Include width measurements in prompts
    - Focus on spatial constraints
    - Emphasize linear/galley layouts
    - Specify "no island" explicitly
    
    💡 Tips:
    - Minimum 100 high-quality galley kitchen images
    - Consistent naming and prompting
    - Include various styles (modern, minimalist, traditional galley)
    - Mix of rendered and real photos
    - Focus on narrow (2.5-4m) kitchen spaces
