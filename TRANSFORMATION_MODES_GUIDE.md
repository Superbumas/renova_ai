# Transformation Modes Guide

## Overview

The kitchen redesign AI now supports two distinct transformation modes that give users control over how much the AI modifies their original kitchen image:

- **🔧 REPAIR MODE**: Conservative approach focused on structure preservation
- **🎨 WILD MODE**: Creative freedom allowing dramatic transformations

## Mode Comparison

| Aspect | Repair Mode (0.3) | Wild Mode (0.9) |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Prompt Strength** | 0.3 | 0.9 |
| **Structure Preservation** | Maximum | Minimal |
| **Layout Changes** | Prohibited | Allowed |
| **Creative Freedom** | Limited | Maximum |
| **Use Case** | Surface-level updates | Complete redesigns |
| **Guidance Scale** | 7.5 (balanced) | 12.0 (strong) |
| **Inference Steps** | 50 (efficient) | 60 (detailed) |

## Repair Mode (0.3 Prompt Strength)

### Purpose
Perfect for users who love their kitchen layout but want to update the style, colors, or materials.

### What It Preserves
- ✅ Original room layout and dimensions
- ✅ Wall positions and windows
- ✅ Cabinet placement and structure
- ✅ Appliance locations
- ✅ Overall spatial arrangement

### What It Changes
- 🎨 Cabinet colors and finishes
- 🎨 Countertop materials
- 🎨 Backsplash designs
- 🎨 Hardware and fixtures
- 🎨 Lighting styles
- 🎨 Paint colors

### Prompting Strategy
```
Repair Mode Prompt:
"Redesign kitchen: [style]. PRESERVE layout, walls, windows. Change colors, materials only."

Negative Prompts:
"different room layout, moving walls, changing windows, different architecture"
```

### Model Behavior
- Uses ControlNet Canny edge detection when available for maximum structure preservation
- Conservative guidance scale (7.5) for balanced results
- Strict spatial constraints for narrow spaces
- Focuses on surface-level transformations

### Best For
- Rental properties (no structural changes)
- Budget-conscious renovations
- Users happy with current layout
- Quick style updates
- Preserving functional workflows

## Wild Mode (0.9 Prompt Strength)

### Purpose
For users who want dramatic, magazine-worthy transformations with complete creative freedom.

### What It Allows
- 🚀 Complete layout redesigns
- 🚀 Moving or adding islands
- 🚀 Changing cabinet configurations
- 🚀 Dramatic style transformations
- 🚀 Luxury material upgrades
- 🚀 Creative spatial solutions

### What It Preserves
- 🏠 Basic room boundaries (walls)
- 🏠 Window and door locations (usually)
- 🏠 Overall room proportions

### Prompting Strategy
```
Wild Mode Prompt:
"Transform kitchen: [style]. Complete redesign allowed. Dramatic transformation, luxury finishes."

Negative Prompts (minimal):
"blurry, low quality, cartoon, unrealistic, distorted"
```

### Model Behavior
- Skips ControlNet for maximum creative freedom
- Higher guidance scale (12.0) for dramatic results
- More inference steps (60) for detailed generation
- Flexible spatial suggestions instead of strict constraints
- Allows layout and structural changes

### Best For
- Complete kitchen renovations
- Dream kitchen visualizations
- High-end design inspiration
- Creative exploration
- Magazine-worthy transformations

## Technical Implementation

### API Usage
```json
{
  "image": "base64_image_data",
  "mode": "redesign",
  "style": "Modern",
  "transformationMode": "repair",  // or "wild"
  "inspirationImage": "pinterest_url",
  "measurements": [...]
}
```

### Model Selection Priority

#### Repair Mode
1. **ControlNet Canny** (primary): Maximum structure preservation with edge detection
2. **adirik/interior-design** (fallback): Conservative parameters (0.3 strength)
3. **SDXL** (final fallback): Conservative parameters

#### Wild Mode
1. **adirik/interior-design** (primary): Aggressive parameters (0.9 strength)
2. **SDXL** (fallback): Aggressive parameters

### Parameter Differences

```python
# Repair Mode Parameters
prompt_strength = 0.3      # Conservative
guidance_scale = 7.5       # Balanced
num_inference_steps = 50   # Efficient
token_limit = 50          # Concise prompts

# Wild Mode Parameters  
prompt_strength = 0.9      # Aggressive
guidance_scale = 12.0      # Strong guidance
num_inference_steps = 60   # Detailed generation
token_limit = 100         # Detailed prompts
```

## Measurement Integration

### Repair Mode
- **Strict spatial constraints**: "NARROW 2.8m: galley layout only, NO center island"
- **Enforced limitations**: Prevents impossible layouts
- **Conservative suggestions**: Respects physical constraints

### Wild Mode
- **Flexible suggestions**: "NARROW 2.8m: creative linear design solutions"
- **Creative freedom**: Allows innovative space usage
- **Inspirational guidance**: Suggests possibilities rather than restrictions

## Use Case Examples

### Repair Mode Scenarios
1. **Rental Kitchen Update**: Change cabinet color from oak to white, update hardware
2. **Budget Refresh**: New paint, backsplash, and countertops only
3. **Style Modernization**: Update traditional kitchen to contemporary without layout changes
4. **Color Scheme Change**: Switch from warm to cool tones while keeping everything else

### Wild Mode Scenarios
1. **Complete Renovation**: Transform galley kitchen into open-concept with island
2. **Luxury Upgrade**: Add high-end materials, custom cabinetry, professional appliances
3. **Layout Optimization**: Reconfigure for better workflow and entertaining
4. **Dream Kitchen**: Create magazine-worthy design with no budget constraints

## Results and Quality

### Repair Mode Results
- **SSIM Score**: 0.910+ (excellent structural similarity)
- **Consistency**: Highly predictable results
- **User Satisfaction**: High for conservative updates
- **Processing Time**: Faster due to fewer inference steps

### Wild Mode Results
- **Creative Quality**: High visual impact and drama
- **Variety**: More diverse and unique outputs
- **Inspiration Value**: Excellent for design exploration
- **Processing Time**: Slightly longer due to more inference steps

## Best Practices

### When to Use Repair Mode
- ✅ You like your current layout
- ✅ Budget or rental constraints
- ✅ Quick style updates needed
- ✅ Functional kitchen that works well
- ✅ Want predictable results

### When to Use Wild Mode
- ✅ Complete renovation planned
- ✅ Seeking design inspiration
- ✅ Current layout doesn't work
- ✅ Want dramatic transformation
- ✅ No structural constraints

### Frontend Integration
The frontend should:
1. **Clearly explain** the difference between modes
2. **Show examples** of repair vs wild results
3. **Recommend mode** based on user goals
4. **Display mode used** in results
5. **Allow easy switching** between modes

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Hybrid Mode**: 0.6 prompt strength for balanced approach
2. **Custom Strength**: User-selectable prompt strength slider
3. **Area-Specific Control**: Different modes for different kitchen zones
4. **Style-Specific Defaults**: Automatic mode selection based on style
5. **Progressive Transformation**: Multiple steps from repair to wild

### Advanced Features
1. **Before/After Comparison**: Side-by-side mode comparison
2. **Confidence Scoring**: How much the AI changed the original
3. **Preservation Metrics**: Quantify structure preservation
4. **User Feedback Loop**: Learn from user preferences
5. **Smart Mode Selection**: AI-recommended mode based on image analysis

## Conclusion

The two-mode system provides users with precise control over their kitchen transformation experience:

- **Repair Mode**: Perfect for conservative updates with maximum structure preservation
- **Wild Mode**: Ideal for dramatic transformations with complete creative freedom

This approach addresses the core issue of AI models either being too conservative or too aggressive, giving users the power to choose their preferred level of transformation.
